# First-steps-in-NumPy-nad-Pandas

Based on the results of wastewater analyzes from the buffer tank, I prepared the "Buffer_Tank_data.csv" file. 
Based on the value of a particular parameter, the program generates a diagram showing the change of these values as a function of time.

Generating a diagram from data for a specific parameter
1. Read a csv file.
2. The csv file doesnâ€™t have a header, hence setting the header parameter to None.
3. Set the names of each column explicitely by setting the df.columns attribute
4. Some methods about Dataframe.
5. Create a function which converts string objects to a date format.
6. Using the above function to format the value in the "Date / Date" column
7. Change the autoincremental ID generated by pandas and use the Timestamp DS column as the Index
8. Create a function which masks missing values in column
9. Create a function which removes undesirable signs from the values to obtain specific numbers
10. Assigning numbers to column names - creating a dictionary
11. User decides which parameter (according to the selected number) will be presented on the diagram.
